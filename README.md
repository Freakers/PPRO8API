<H1>Introduction to PProAPI</H1>
<p>The PPro API is a WEB based application programming interface which allows traders at Day Trade The World to create various custom trading tools that augment and integrate with the Ralota Trading platform used by the firm. This allows the trader to create various realtime trading tools to assist in various trading tasks. The following are some of the examples of trading tools that I require to assist in my trading strategies: 
<li>Order and Rrisk Management</li>
<li>Closing Imbalance and Closing Auction performance for North American and European Markets</li>
<li>Realtime Feed Readers to monitor level 1 and level 2 quotes</li>
<li>Realtime monitoring of time of sale prints for price and volume</li>
<li>Consolidate feeds (Level 1, Level 2, Time Of Sale, OrderStarus into a consioildated feed</li>
<li>Create algorithmic trading bots that monitor the market and execute trading startegies</li>
</p>
<H2>Overview of API</H2>
<p>The API requires that the Ralota Trading Platform be installed on your PC and that you have a valid user account and password setup. This is not a standalone API library and must integrate to the Ralota trading platform while it is running to allow API calls to be routed to the back end servers to provide realtime trading. Due to the way this product is architected the trading platform must always be running in order to use the API and it does not require any authetication because the authetication is provided through the trading platform's user authetication process.</p>
