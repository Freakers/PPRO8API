<H1>Introduction to PProAPI</H1>
<p>The PPro Api is a URL based API which allows traders at Day Trade The World to create various custom trading tools that augment and integrate with the Ralota Trading platform used by the firm.

<H2>Overview of API</H2>
<H3>How to Use the API</H3>
<p>The API requires that the Ralota Trading Platform be installed on your PC and that you have a valid user account and password setup. The API is not a standalone library and integrates to the trading platform which allows API calls to be routed to the back end servers to provide realtime trading via REST calls.</p>
<p>The API must first be enabled on your account in order to communicate with the back end servers. You must contact your trading supervisor and request the the API access be enabled on your account. The process of enabling the account takes approximately 24 hours</p>
